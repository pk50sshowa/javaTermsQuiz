## Developer Comments

After starting the quiz, a 60 second timer is started. Players get 10 points for guessing a question correctly, but if they make a mistake, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer.
The game ends when either 60 seconds have passed or all questions have been answered.
When finished, players can enter their initials, which will be displayed with their final score (max score: 50 points.)
